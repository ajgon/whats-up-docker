Feature: Prometheus exposure

  Scenario: WUD must expose prometheus metrics
    When I GET /metrics
    Then response code should be 200
    And response body should contain wud_watcher_total
    And response body should contain wud_registry_response
    And response body should contain wud_trigger_count
    And response body should contain process_cpu_user_seconds_total
    And response body should contain nodejs_eventloop_lag_seconds

    And response body should contain wud_images{registry="hub"
    And response body should contain wud_images{registry="hub"

    And response body should contain wud_update_available{registry="hub"
    And response body should contain wud_update_available{registry="hub"


  Scenario Outline: WUD must expose watched images
    When I GET /metrics
    Then response code should be 200
    And response body should contain registry="<registry>"
    And response body should contain registry_url="<registryUrl>"
    And response body should contain image="<image>"
    And response body should contain version="<version>"
    And response body should contain new_version="<newVersion>"
